## New things that I learn during this project

1. Vercel - Frontend deployment
2. React - Working with "State" and creating components
3. Github - Not something new, but I have better understanding
4. Chart - Created chart component

## Challenges that I face during this project

As I was not familiar with React.js, I decided that this project will be a good chance for me to beef up my knowledge on React. Using the online course, I was guided on how React works, creating components. I realized that there are still so much I dont know. I will definitely continue to create frontend application using React for practice. 
## Things that I will do more if I had more time

1. There are concepts that I am still dont understand. If I have more time, I would spend more time doing trial and error. 
2. I will spend more time beefing up my javascript.
3. I will also explore on how to work with other team-mates using Github. 
4. Incoporate user sign in using Auth0
5. Explore using database to store user log in details and expenses data.
