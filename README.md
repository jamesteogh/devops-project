An Personalized Expense Tracker application which allows user to add new expense into the tracker, enabling the user to track its expense history illustrated by charts categorized by month and year. 

## Technologies used:

This project consist of only 1 repositiory. The technology comprises React and NodeJS. This Frontend React application is deployed on Vercel. 
## New things that I learn during this project

1. Vercel - Frontend deployment
2. React - Working with "State" and creating components
3. Chart - Created chart components
4. Github - Not something new, but through this project I have a better understanding.

## Challenges that I face during this project

As I was not familiar with React.js, I decided that this project will be a good chance for me to beef up my knowledge on React. Using the online course, I was guided on how React works, creating components. I realized that there are still so much I dont know. I will definitely continue to create frontend application using React for fun practice. 
## Things that I will do more if I had more time

1. There are concepts that I am still dont understand. If I have more time, I would spend more time doing trial and error. 
2. I will spend more time beefing up my javascript.
3. I will also explore on how to work with other team-mates using Github. 
4. Incoporate user sign in with Auth0
5. Explore using database to store user log in details and expenses data. 
6. Incoporate categorization of type of expenses to allow user to filter
7. Incoporate Pie chart using Chart.js to provide better illustration for user to view expenses filter by month and categorization.
